The purpose of this project is to shed light on weaknesses and privacy leaks among modern anti-fingerprinting extensions and browsers.

1. Detect and ignore JavaScript tampering (prototype lies)
2. Fingerprint lie patterns
3. Fingerprint extension code
4. Fingerprint browser privacy settings
5. Use large-scale validation and collect inconsistencies
6. Feature detect and fingerprint [new APIs](https://www.javascripture.com/) that contain high entropy
7. For fingerprinting, use APIs that are the most difficult to fake

Tests are focused on:

* Tor Browser (SL 1 & 2)
* Firefox (RFP)
* ungoogled-chromium (fingerprint deception)
* Brave Browser (Standard/Strict)
* puppeteer-extra
* FakeBrowser
* Bromite
* uBlock Origin (aopr)
* NoScript
* DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials
* JShelter (JavaScript Restrictor)
* Privacy Badger
* Privacy Possum
* Random User-Agent
* User Agent Switcher and Manager
* CanvasBlocker
* Trace
* CyDec
* Chameleon
* ScriptSafe
* Windscribe
